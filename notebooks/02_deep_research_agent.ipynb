            "Notable data points / flavor drivers  \n",
            "- Black salt (¼ tsp) supplies sulfuric “egg” note; turmeric (¼ tsp) adds yellow color.  \n",
            "- Miso (1 tsp) and freshly cracked pepper deepen umami and mimic traditional spice.  \n",

            "# Evolution from Java Servlets to Spring Boot Framework\n",
            "\n",
            "## 1. Java Servlets\n",
            "Java Servlets were introduced in the mid-1990s to extend the capabilities of Java applets on the server side. Servlets run inside servlet containers like Apache Tomcat and are used to handle HTTP requests and generate dynamic content.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Problems:\n",
            "- **Boilerplate Code**: Developers had to write a lot of boilerplate code to handle HTTP requests and manage the lifecycle of servlets.\n",
            "- **Manual Configuration**: Servlets required manual configuration in the `web.xml` file, which was error-prone and difficult to maintain.\n",
            "- **Tight Coupling**: Business logic was tightly coupled with presentation logic, making the codebase difficult to test and maintain.\n",
            "- **No Dependency Management**: There was no built-in dependency management, making it difficult to manage and inject dependencies.\n",
            "\n",
            "## 2. Spring Framework (2003)\n",
            "The Spring Framework was introduced to address the limitations of Java Servlets and to provide a more robust and flexible solution for building enterprise Java applications.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Problems Solved:\n",
            "- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Spring introduced DI, which allowed developers to decouple components and manage dependencies externally, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.\n",
            "- **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: Spring's IoC container managed the creation and lifecycle of objects, reducing the need for manual object creation and configuration.\n",
            "- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: Spring provided AOP support, allowing developers to separate cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transaction management from business logic.\n",
            "- **Modular Architecture**: Spring was organized into modules, allowing developers to use only what they needed, promoting lightweight and customizable applications.\n",
            "- **Transaction Management**: Spring provided a consistent abstraction over various transaction APIs, simplifying database operations.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Core Functionalities:\n",
            "- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Enables loose coupling between components, making applications more modular, flexible, and easier to test.\n",
            "- **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: Manages object creation, configuration, and lifecycle through the Spring container.\n",
            "- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: Separates cross-cutting concerns from business logic, allowing these behaviors to be applied declaratively across multiple components.\n",
            "- **Transaction Management**: Provides a consistent abstraction over various transaction APIs, supporting both programmatic and declarative transaction control.\n",
            "- **Spring MVC Framework**: Supports building web applications using the Model-View-Controller pattern, enabling clean separation of concerns and facilitating RESTful web services.\n",
            "- **Modular Architecture**: The framework is organized into about 20 modules, allowing developers to use only what they need, promoting lightweight and customizable applications.\n",
            "- **Testing Support**: Offers robust support for unit and integration testing, including mocking, context configuration, and caching.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Essential Knowledge for Developers:\n",
            "- **Understanding DI and IoC**: Fundamental to using Spring effectively.\n",
            "- **Configuration Styles**: Be proficient in annotation-based, XML, and Java config.\n",
            "- **Spring Boot Basics**: Recommended starting point for new Spring applications.\n",
            "- **Web Development**: Know Spring MVC for traditional web apps and WebFlux for reactive programming.\n",
            "- **Data Access**: Familiarity with Spring Data, JPA, JDBC, and transaction management.\n",
            "- **Modular Design**: Understand how Spring modules work and how to include only what's needed.\n",
            "- **API Design & Best Practices**: Follow Spring’s principles of flexibility, backward compatibility, and clean code.\n",
            "- **Integration Skills**: Ability to integrate with Java EE APIs and third-party libraries.\n",
            "- **Use of Tooling**: Leverage [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) and \"Getting Started\" guides for rapid development.\n",
            "\n",
            "## 3. Spring Boot (2013)\n",
            "Spring Boot was introduced to further simplify the development of Spring applications by providing auto-configuration, embedded servers, and opinionated defaults.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Problems Solved:\n",
            "- **Auto-Configuration**: Spring Boot automatically configures the application based on the dependencies present in the classpath, reducing the need for manual configuration.\n",
            "- **Embedded Servers**: Spring Boot includes embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow, eliminating the need for external server deployment.\n",
            "- **Starter Dependencies**: Spring Boot provides starter dependencies that simplify the inclusion of common libraries and configurations.\n",
            "- **Rapid Prototyping**: Spring Boot enables rapid prototyping and quick development cycles, making it ideal for cloud-native and microservices architectures.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Core Functionalities:\n",
            "- **Auto-Configuration**: Automatically configures the application based on the dependencies present in the classpath.\n",
            "- **Embedded Servers**: Includes embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow, eliminating the need for external server deployment.\n",
            "- **Starter Dependencies**: Provides starter dependencies that simplify the inclusion of common libraries and configurations.\n",
            "- **Actuator**: Provides production-ready features like health checks, metrics, and endpoint management.\n",
            "- **Spring Boot CLI**: A command-line interface for rapidly prototyping and testing Spring applications.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Essential Knowledge for Developers:\n",
            "- **Understanding Spring Boot**: Familiarity with Spring Boot's auto-configuration and embedded server features.\n",
            "- **Starter Dependencies**: Knowledge of how to use starter dependencies to simplify the inclusion of common libraries and configurations.\n",
            "- **Actuator**: Understanding of how to use Spring Boot Actuator for production-ready features like health checks and metrics.\n",
            "- **Cloud-Native Development**: Familiarity with cloud-native development practices and how Spring Boot supports microservices and cloud deployment.\n",
            "- **Testing Support**: Understanding of how to use Spring Boot's testing features for unit and integration testing.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, the evolution from Java Servlets to the Spring Boot framework has addressed the limitations of each previous iteration, providing a more robust, flexible, and efficient solution for building enterprise Java applications. The Spring framework and Spring Boot have become the de facto standards for Java web development, offering a comprehensive set of tools and functionalities to support modern application development.\n",
