Include 4-day sample itinerary, weather notes, transport tips, safety, and alternatives (briefly) depending on budget preferences. No further searches required under tool call limits.\\n\\nI will now prepare the answer summarizing recommendation, sample 4-day itinerary, practical tips, and alternatives.\\\"\"}\n",

            "Final response: Thanks — that helps a lot. Based on “nature” + solo + May + 4 days, my top recommendation is Ljubljana (Slovenia) as the best city base. Before I give details: do you want mostly easy, relaxed nature (lakes, gentle hikes, scenic drives) or do you prefer more active/outdoor adventure (longer hikes, climbing, or adrenaline activities)? If not, I’ll assume relaxed-to-moderate activities.\n"
