            "Summary: The summary from the SACN and COT assessment highlights the health benefits and risks associated with consuming plant-based drinks, particularly in relation to children under 5 years old. While plant-based drinks, such as soy and oat milk, are increasingly popular alternatives to cow's milk, they do not provide the same nutritional profile. Cow's milk is a significant source of calcium, protein, and essential vitamins for young children, and if it is excluded from their diet, careful consideration must be given to ensure adequate nutrient intake from other sources.\n",

            "Fortification of plant-based drinks varies widely; some are fortified with calcium, vitamin D, and other nutrients, while others may not be fortified at all. The guidance suggests that parents should look for fortified options to help meet the nutritional needs of children, especially for calcium and vitamin D. However, many plant-based drinks are classified as ultra-processed and may contain added sugars, which could be a concern for children's health.\n",
            "\n",
            "For children under 5, it is crucial to ensure that any plant-based milk consumed is fortified and that it complements a balanced diet to provide necessary nutrients.

            "- Fat quality: Most plant milks are low in saturated fat (healthier fats), but coconut milk beverages are higher in saturated fat and calories and generally less favorable for heart‑health goals. [Reviews]\n",
            "- Safety for young children: Pediatric and national guidance advise caution substituting plant drinks for cow’s milk in young children. For toddlers/children, choose fortified soy (or other fortified) milks that provide adequate protein, calcium and vitamin D; rice drinks are discouraged for young children because of arsenic concerns. Infants under 12 months should not use plant milks in place of breastmilk/formula. [Sources: North American pediatric society position; NHS; SACN summary]\n",

            "- Pull a quick nutrient table (protein, calcium, calories, sugar, saturated fat per cup) for soy, pea, oat, almond, rice and coconut milks from USDA/FoodDataCentral or a recent survey so you can see numbers side‑by‑side.  \n",
